# CashDog - helping dogs with every trade

CashDog smart contract. $CASHDOG is a combination of RFI tokenomics with the added functions of auto-liquidity generation, auto-charity rewards generation, and auto-dev expense generation. A percentage of every trade goes to help a selected dog charity organization.  CashDog was developed by the LOOT Degen Club - run by the NFTLootBox (LOOT) Team who are doxxed and have a proven track record. CashDog is community owned and driven - no rug is possible. #CASHDOG - Make a Difference! Join us today!
